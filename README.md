# Epic7-Guildwar-Calculator
A calculator that outputs unit stats based on combat inputs

Presently, the calculator receives input and sends output to a Google Sheet.

It receives Combat Readiness percentages, and based on these percentages, detects the fastest unit, and outputs enemy unit speeds.

Future adjustments will strive to obtain additional data, such as the artifacts, and health/defense data, and output them to be more visually appealing.
