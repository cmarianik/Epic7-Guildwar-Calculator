# Epic7-Guildwar-Calculator
A calculator that outputs unit stats based on combat inputs

Presently, the calculator receives input and sends output to a Google Sheet.
NOTES: To use this program for yourself, you will have to make your own spreadsheet and link it in the SheetsQuickStart spreadsheetId. 
This program was also built using Gradle. You will need to create an OAuth 2.0 token using the Google API and download the token into the Gradle token folder.

This program receives Combat Readiness percentages, and based on these percentages, detects the fastest unit, and outputs enemy unit speeds.

Future adjustments will strive to obtain additional data, such as the artifacts, and health/defense data, and output them to be more visually appealing.
